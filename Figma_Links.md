App Name: Explorer Figma(https://www.figma.com/design/5cehA93xswMYrMwht4OLB5/Explorer?node-id=0-1&t=pOmqYw1dknKxiY79-1)

Explorer is a location-based app designed to help users discover trending places, nearby attractions, and receive personalized recommendations based on their interests. With an intuitive interface and real-time location tracking, Explorer makes it easy to find exciting new destinations and hidden gems tailored to your preferences.

Whether you're a travel enthusiast or an adventurer, the app helps you explore the world around you, offering real-time information about nearby attractions, trending spots, and personalized recommendations. Users can also contribute by sharing their experiences through blogs, marking favorite places, and using an interactive map to navigate.

This project is my first experience with Figma, where I'm learning how to create basic components and bring ideas like Explorer to life visually.
